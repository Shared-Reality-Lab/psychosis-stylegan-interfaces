#### Setup
The optimization needs an originals/ folder under static containing the StyleGAN images (e.g., seed87014.png) \[0-99999] to work with the .csv maps and hotspots.json currently included in the repo.

run docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans --force-recreate -d

Change the port number inside docker-compose.yml if it shows port is being used.
